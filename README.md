# CHEERS!

Cheers is a minimalistic web-app that polls 2 rest APIs and stores their responses in a MongoDB database. It then fetches the ten most recent insertions and updates the UI with their attributes.

This project was done as part of the Internship assignment given to me by the company "TachStax Private Limited".

## Changes to be done

### File Name: .sample_env

1. Rename the file to ".env".
2. Replace the occurence of "YOUR_MONGODB_URI_HERE" with the uri of mongodb database.

<b>Note: The databse must be named cheers-db and should contain two collections named drinks and users respectivley. </b>
