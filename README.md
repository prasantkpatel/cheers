# CHEERS!

Cheers is a minimalistic web-app that polls 2 rest APIs and stores their responses in a MongoDB database. It then fetches the ten most recent insertions and updates the UI with their attributes.

This project is done as part of the Internship assignment given to me by the company "TachStax Private Limited".

Rename ".sample_env" to ".env" and replace the "YOUR_MONGODB_URI_HERE" with the actual mongodb uri.
